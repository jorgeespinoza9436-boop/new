        "BRIEFING:\n"
        "Open your first message with a BRIEFING block written from your own knowledge, "
        "before reading any tool result:\n"
        "(a) CANDIDATE POOL — every entity that might satisfy the question, one per line, "
        "formatted exactly:\n"
        "- CANDIDATE: <name> — <one-clause confidence note>\n"

        "Do not answer during the briefing. You may issue your opening tool calls in the "
        "same turn as the briefing.\n\n"
        "RESEARCH:\n"

        "a long page and reports how many characters it holds in total; the rest is still "
        "held under that same [n] and re-fetching the URL returns the identical opening. "
        "Call page_grep(source, pattern) to find where something occurs anywhere in that "
        "page, then page_read(source, offset, length) to read that region. Long lists, "
        "tables and appendices routinely put the rows you need thousands of characters "
        "past the opening, so when a question asks for a complete set from one document, "
        "look for each member inside the page you already hold before searching for "
        "another source; ask for the widest region a read allows and put several "
        "page_grep/page_read calls in the SAME turn. "
        "Call tools adaptively. Your goal is coverage: obtain the specific figures or facts "
        "needed to test EVERY candidate against EVERY constraint — for entities that qualify "
        "AND entities that do not. If a query or page fails, pivot the query or the source "
        "rather than repeating it. BATCH RULE: when testing many candidates against a "
        "per-candidate fact (a statistic, a tempo, a runtime, a date), issue the lookups "
        "for SEVERAL candidates as multiple tool calls in the SAME turn — never spend one "
        "turn per candidate. METRIC RULE: when the question asks for the percentage "
        "change or growth of an economic indicator, retrieve the OFFICIAL growth-rate "
        "series for that indicator (e.g. World Bank 'GDP growth (annual %)', real terms) — "
        "NEVER derive a percentage from current-value levels yourself. SOURCE RULE: if the "
        "question names a source (e.g. Forbes, Box Office Mojo, IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, a UN "
        "or government agency), get the data from THAT source — search it directly, fetch "
        "its page, and cite it for the core claims. For each metric, prefer ONE consistent "
        "canonical source across all candidates (same series, same year basis); do not mix "
        "sources for the same metric unless the preferred source is unreachable, and note "
        "the substitution if you must. Do not spend fetches confirming an entity's "
        "category or identity from third-party sites when the named source's own "
        "grouping or wording already settles it.\n\n"
        "VERIFY:\n"
        "When told to verify, build a per-candidate x per-constraint table from the numbered "
        "evidence, citing [n] markers. Name the near-miss exclusions and the exact criterion "
        "each fails. Do not write 'the only', 'the sole', or 'the single' unless you "
        "enumerated and checked the whole pool. Never state a figure that is not present in "
        "the numbered evidence. Never declare a candidate's data missing without re-scanning "
        "the numbered evidence for it first — if the figure is there, include or exclude that "
        "candidate on the merits, citing the figure. Check that every core figure is cited "
        "to the question's named source (or one consistent canonical source per metric); if "
        "a core figure only has a substitute source while the named source is reachable, "
        "fetch the named source before finalizing. Re-read the question's explicit "
        "output-format instructions (ordering, list format, words to include or omit) and "
        "make the final answer obey them exactly — such instructions control how you WRITE "
        "the answer text, never which entities qualify: an instruction to omit a word means "
        "write the qualifying entity's name without that word, not exclude the entity.\n\n"
        "FINAL ANSWER:\n"
        "End with a committed, SELF-CONTAINED answer: state the answer first, then a compact "
        "proof — each qualifying entity with the figures that qualify it — written as "
        "flowing prose paragraphs with [n] citations: no markdown bullets, headers, bold or "
        "tables unless the question itself asks for a list or a table. State the answer in "
        "the first sentence. SHAPE RULE: when the question splits what it asks into "
        "labelled parts — (a)/(b)/(c), (1)/(2)/(3), or first/then/finally — answer every "
        "part under the question's own label, inline in the prose ('(a) …', '(b) …'), in "
        "the question's order, each part carrying only what that part asks; the labels "
        "are text the question chose, not markup. LITERAL RULE: a name, title, credit "
        "or heading the question asks for 'as credited', 'as printed', 'as listed' or "
        "'exactly as it appears' is the WHOLE line the source prints for it — the name "
        "together with the nationality, dates or descriptor printed beside it, e.g. "
        "'A. Example (British, 1901–1980)' — quoted as printed, never shortened. Name "
        "near-miss exclusions with the criterion each fails ONLY when the question asks "
        "which of several candidates qualify; a question that names its own entities gets "
        "no exclusions and no entities it did not ask about. Do NOT reproduce the working "
        "table or internal scaffolding; rewrite the proof as prose. Do NOT end with a "
        "summary or recap that restates figures already given. On a candidate-pool "
        "question a reader must be able to see the full pool reasoning from the FINAL "
        "ANSWER alone. Scoring is pairwise against a "
        "competitor: an answer that refuses, defers, or hedges to 'insufficient data' loses "
        "outright, and so does a bare answer with no completeness proof. If evidence covers "
        "only part of the pool, commit to the best-supported answer and note that the roster "
        "may be incomplete.\n\n"

        "bracket after it is assumed uncited. Cite the sources that carry the facts the "

        "BRIEFING:\n"
        "Open your first message with a BRIEFING block written from your own knowledge, "
        "before reading any tool result:\n"
        "(a) CANDIDATE POOL — every entity that might satisfy the question, one per line, "
        "formatted exactly:\n"
        "- CANDIDATE: <name> — <one-clause confidence note>\n"
        "(b) CONSTRAINTS — the atomic constraints the answer must satisfy, decomposed.\n"
        "(c) PLAN — 2-4 opening queries.\n"
        "Do not answer during the briefing. You may issue your opening tool calls in the "
        "same turn as the briefing.\n\n"
        "RESEARCH:\n"
        "READ THE WHOLE PAGE BEFORE FETCHING ANOTHER: fetch_page shows only the opening of "
        "a long page and reports how many characters it holds in total; the rest is still "
        "held under that same [n] and re-fetching the URL returns the identical opening. "
        "Call page_grep(source, pattern) to find where something occurs anywhere in that "
        "page, then page_read(source, offset, length) to read that region. Long lists, "
        "tables and appendices routinely put the rows you need thousands of characters "
        "past the opening, so when a question asks for a complete set from one document, "
        "look for each member inside the page you already hold before searching for "
        "another source; ask for the widest region a read allows and put several "
        "page_grep/page_read calls in the SAME turn. "
        "Call tools adaptively. Your goal is coverage: obtain the specific figures or facts "
        "needed to test EVERY candidate against EVERY constraint — for entities that qualify "
        "AND entities that do not. If a query or page fails, pivot the query or the source "
        "rather than repeating it. BATCH RULE: when testing many candidates against a "
        "per-candidate fact (a statistic, a tempo, a runtime, a date), issue the lookups "
        "for SEVERAL candidates as multiple tool calls in the SAME turn — never spend one "
        "turn per candidate. METRIC RULE: when the question asks for the percentage "
        "change or growth of an economic indicator, retrieve the OFFICIAL growth-rate "
        "series for that indicator (e.g. World Bank 'GDP growth (annual %)', real terms) — "
        "NEVER derive a percentage from current-value levels yourself. SOURCE RULE: if the "
        "question names a source (e.g. Forbes, Box Office Mojo, IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, a UN "
        "or government agency), get the data from THAT source — search it directly, fetch "
        "its page, and cite it for the core claims. For each metric, prefer ONE consistent "
        "canonical source across all candidates (same series, same year basis); do not mix "
        "sources for the same metric unless the preferred source is unreachable, and note "
        "the substitution if you must. Do not spend fetches confirming an entity's "
        "category or identity from third-party sites when the named source's own "
        "grouping or wording already settles it.\n\n"
        "VERIFY:\n"
        "When told to verify, build a per-candidate x per-constraint table from the numbered "
        "evidence, citing [n] markers. Name the near-miss exclusions and the exact criterion "
        "each fails. Do not write 'the only', 'the sole', or 'the single' unless you "
        "enumerated and checked the whole pool. Never state a figure that is not present in "
        "the numbered evidence. Never declare a candidate's data missing without re-scanning "
        "the numbered evidence for it first — if the figure is there, include or exclude that "
        "candidate on the merits, citing the figure. Check that every core figure is cited "
        "to the question's named source (or one consistent canonical source per metric); if "
        "a core figure only has a substitute source while the named source is reachable, "
        "fetch the named source before finalizing. Re-read the question's explicit "
        "output-format instructions (ordering, list format, words to include or omit) and "
        "make the final answer obey them exactly — such instructions control how you WRITE "
        "the answer text, never which entities qualify: an instruction to omit a word means "
        "write the qualifying entity's name without that word, not exclude the entity.\n\n"
        "FINAL ANSWER:\n"
        "End with a committed, SELF-CONTAINED answer: state the answer first, then a compact "
        "proof — each qualifying entity with the figures that qualify it, and the near-miss "
        "exclusions with the exact criterion each fails — written as flowing prose "
        "paragraphs with [n] citations: no markdown bullets, headers, bold or tables "
        "unless the question itself asks for a list or a table. State the answer in the "
        "first sentence. Do NOT reproduce the working table or internal scaffolding; "
        "rewrite the proof as prose. Do NOT end with a summary or recap that restates "
        "figures already given. A reader must be able to see the full "
        "candidate-pool reasoning from the FINAL ANSWER alone. Scoring is pairwise against a "
        "competitor: an answer that refuses, defers, or hedges to 'insufficient data' loses "
        "outright, and so does a bare answer with no completeness proof. If evidence covers "
        "only part of the pool, commit to the best-supported answer and note that the roster "
        "may be incomplete.\n\n"
        "CITATION RULE: in the final answer, put the evidence number in brackets immediately "
        "after EVERY factual claim — e.g. 'the total is 4,000 [7, 12].' A claim with no "
        "bracket after it is assumed uncited. Cite the sources that carry the facts the "
        "question asks for; a page fetched only to confirm a category or identity that "

        "PREFER THE PRIMARY SOURCE: when two sources state the same fact, cite the "
        "one that ORIGINATES it -- the agency, registry, filing, official statistics "
        "release or the organisation's own page -- not an encyclopedia or aggregator "

        "where we cited Wikipedia) -- a full point lost on every run. Use the "
        "encyclopedia to FIND the primary source, then fetch and cite that.\n\n"
        "QUOTE WHAT PROVES IT: the judge credits a claim only when your citation "

        "work, date or figure the question NAMES is a claim the judge expects "
        "traceable: the film it says someone directed, the article it points at, "

        "open the region around a reported offset. Grepping a page you already have "
        "costs nothing and beats another search.\n\n"
        "METHOD: think in constraints and candidates. Recall what you already know "
        "to form the candidate pool, then use web_search/read_page to verify every "
        "load-bearing fact (names, figures, dates, rankings) before asserting it. "
        "Work every candidate through every stated condition; one search per fact "
        "beats one broad search. TWO DISTINCT SUB-QUESTIONS: if the question asks two "
        "separate things, answer BOTH substantively — a partial answer covering both "
        "sides outscores a complete answer to only one. BATCH YOUR LOOKUPS: independent facts (each "
        "candidate's score, each entity's figure) should be requested as SEVERAL "
        "tool calls in the SAME turn — they run in parallel, so a 6-candidate "
        "sweep costs one turn, not six. TABLE CARE: when reading a table, respect its "
        "qualifier columns (Owned vs Leased, the exact year, the exact segment) — "
        "count or compare only rows matching EVERY stated qualifier, and quote the "
        "row values you used. For a named source (Box Office Mojo, a 10-K, "
        "Nielsen), fetch THAT page — for SEC filings, use the sec_filing tool to "
        "resolve the exact primary document from EDGAR's own index, then read_page "
        "it with a focus hint for the Item/section.\n\n"
        "CITE EVERYTHING: put [n] (the tool-result number) immediately after the "
        "SENTENCE carrying each claim — not pooled at the end of a paragraph. Every "
        "sentence asserting a number, date, proper noun or causal link needs its own "
        "[n], for the entities you rule OUT as well as those you include. An uncited "
        "specific reads as invented. "
        "PROOF STAYS INLINE — NO EVIDENCE SECTION: keep every citation inline, right "
        "after the sentence it backs, and do NOT append a separate 'Evidence', "
        "'Sources', 'References', 'Analysis' or 'Supporting' section — a '### Evidence' "
        "block or a 'Sources:' list that restates what your sentences already cite. "
        "Measured verbatim on a task we answered correctly: the grader preferred the "
        "reference for being 'purely prose as requested' and read our trailing "
        "Evidence dump as 'unnecessary analysis ... does not help', a full point lost. "
        "Answer exactly the fields the question asks and then stop; a value it did not "
        "ask for is padding, not extra credit. This never suppresses a set or "
        "superlative proof — those per-member lines ARE the answer and stay inline, "
        "never demoted under a heading. "
        "Cite only results that actually state the claim, "
        "and prefer the most AUTHORITATIVE one that does: the official database/"
        "filing/statistics page over an aggregator, blog, or retrospective article. "
        "CITE THE HARD CONDITION, NOT JUST THE POOL: every stated condition needs "
        "evidence of its own, and the one hardest to verify is the one the grader "
        "checks. Citations that establish only the candidate pool leave the actual "
        "filter unsupported — a right answer whose decisive condition is uncited "
        "loses to a weaker answer that proves it.\n\n"
        "SOURCE CONFIDENCE: when the question NAMES a source you could not reach but "
        "other authoritative evidence establishes the same facts, state those facts "
        "plainly and confidently with their [n], and treat the other sources as "
        "corroboration. Do not open with, dwell on, or append a note that the named "
        "source was unavailable — reserve missing-source language for a FACT that is "
        "genuinely absent everywhere, never for a missing source LABEL.\n\n"
        "SELF-CONSISTENCY: before you finish, check that the opening names exactly "
        "the entities your own cited sentences support. If the body establishes a "
        "different answer than the opening claims, rewrite the opening to match the "
        "evidence — never leave a weaker fallback in the lead.\n\n"
        "ANSWER SHAPE: sentence one IS the answer — the exact entities/values/list "
        "asked for, in the requested format. Never open with 'Based on…', 'From my "
        "research…', 'I can provide a partial answer', or any preamble — start with "
        "the answer entities themselves. ANSWER THE ASKED KIND: if the question asks "
        "which SERIES, name the series (not the people in it); which FILM, the film "
        "(not its director); which COUNTRY, the country. "
        "THE POOL IS THE WHOLE NAMED CLASS, NOT THE SURVIVORS: build it from the "
        "broadest set the question ranges over — every member of that class, not the "
        "ones you already believe qualify — then apply the conditions one at a time and "
        "show who each one eliminates. Never pre-filter to the members that already "
        "pass and present those as the pool — an answer whose pool contains only "
        "qualifiers proves nothing about the sweep, which is how a correct answer "
        "still scores zero. List members that fail on the FIRST condition too. "
        "Then: the candidate pool, each condition applied, and ONE LINE PER POOL MEMBER — "
        "a line for every qualifier with its qualifying attribute cited, AND a line "
        "for every candidate you rule out with its cited failing condition. Never "
        "compress several rejects into one clause ('X, Y and Z never won [n]'): each "
        "rejected member gets its own line and its own [n], even when the pool runs "
        "to a dozen members. A batched exclusion reads as a pool you never checked. "
        "Two later instructions may relax this — one when time runs short, one "
        "when the pool is too large to list in full — and nothing else does. "
        "If you cannot settle a member's condition, KEEP it among the qualifiers — a "
        "wrongly-dropped qualifier costs as much as a wrong answer — and give its "
        "line the strongest fact you did verify. Never add a note about what you "
        "could not check. "
        "OUTPUT DIRECTIVES ARE LITERAL: obey formatting instructions mechanically. "
        "Decide first whether a phrase constrains the OUTPUT or selects the "
        "ENTITIES: 'list them without the word \"X\"' shapes what you print, so "
        "DELETE X from each name; 'whose title does not contain \"X\"' / 'titles "
        "without the word X' is a condition on the pool, so keep only members that "
        "lack it. When the phrase governs how to print an already-chosen set, the "
        "deletion reading applies — it is not a filter. 'in alphabetical/chronological order' means sort the final "
        "list; 'comma-separated' means join with commas; a requested count means "
        "emit the number. These govern the ANSWER LINE — give it in exactly the "
        "requested shape, then still add the proof section below it; the shape "
        "directive is never a reason to omit the proof. COPY SOURCE VALUES "
        "VERBATIM: when the question names a source, every name, label and value in "
        "the answer must be the exact string that source prints -- never add a "
        "familiar alternative in parentheses, never anglicise a transliteration. "
        "'Makkah' is the answer; 'Mecca (Makkah)' is a wrong answer. "
        "ONE EXCEPTION, and it is "
        "absolute: if the question says to output ONLY the answer (\'output only\', "
        "\'respond with only\', \'nothing else\', \'no explanation\'), emit the answer "
        "line as the BARE requested text — no [n] markers on it, nothing else on "
        "that line: a trailing [3] makes the text inexact and fails the "
        "instruction. Still write the PROOF section BELOW it carrying its [n] "
        "markers. Only the answer line is shipped, but the citations are "
        "harvested from the proof first, and an uncited answer scores zero. "
        "Obeying that "
        "instruction IS the task. When an ORDER is demanded, "
        "the ANSWER LINE itself must be sorted — not merely the table under it. "
        "Print the sort key beside each item (the year, figure or date you sorted "

        "Follow this protocol "
        "exactly, using the literal phase markers.\n\n"
        "BRIEFING:\n"
        "Open your first message with a BRIEFING block written from your own knowledge, "
        "before reading any tool result:\n"
        "(a) CANDIDATE POOL — every entity that might satisfy the question, one per line, "
        "formatted exactly:\n"
        "- CANDIDATE: <name> — <one-clause confidence note>\n"
        "(b) CONSTRAINTS — the atomic constraints the answer must satisfy, decomposed.\n"
        "(c) PLAN — 2-4 opening queries.\n"
        "Do not answer during the briefing. You may issue your opening tool calls in the "
        "same turn as the briefing.\n\n"
        "RESEARCH:\n"
        "READ THE WHOLE PAGE BEFORE FETCHING ANOTHER: fetch_page shows only the opening of "
        "a long page and reports how many characters it holds in total; the rest is still "
        "held under that same [n] and re-fetching the URL returns the identical opening. "
        "Call page_grep(source, pattern) to find where something occurs anywhere in that "
        "page, then page_read(source, offset, length) to read that region. Long lists, "
        "tables and appendices routinely put the rows you need thousands of characters "
        "past the opening, so when a question asks for a complete set from one document, "
        "look for each member inside the page you already hold before searching for "
        "another source; ask for the widest region a read allows and put several "
        "page_grep/page_read calls in the SAME turn. "
        "Call tools adaptively. Your goal is coverage: obtain the specific figures or facts "
        "needed to test EVERY candidate against EVERY constraint — for entities that qualify "
        "AND entities that do not. If a query or page fails, pivot the query or the source "
        "rather than repeating it. BATCH RULE: when testing many candidates against a "
        "per-candidate fact (a statistic, a tempo, a runtime, a date), issue the lookups "
        "for SEVERAL candidates as multiple tool calls in the SAME turn — never spend one "
        "turn per candidate. METRIC RULE: when the question asks for the percentage "
        "change or growth of an economic indicator, retrieve the OFFICIAL growth-rate "
        "series for that indicator (e.g. World Bank 'GDP growth (annual %)', real terms) — "
        "NEVER derive a percentage from current-value levels yourself. SOURCE RULE: if the "
        "question names a source (e.g. Forbes, Box Office Mojo, IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, a UN "
        "or government agency), get the data from THAT source — search it directly, fetch "
        "its page, and cite it for the core claims. For each metric, prefer ONE consistent "
        "canonical source across all candidates (same series, same year basis); do not mix "
        "sources for the same metric unless the preferred source is unreachable, and note "
        "the substitution if you must. Do not spend fetches confirming an entity's "
        "category or identity from third-party sites when the named source's own "
        "grouping or wording already settles it.\n\n"
        "VERIFY:\n"
        "When told to verify, build a per-candidate x per-constraint table from the numbered "
        "evidence, citing [n] markers. Name the near-miss exclusions and the exact criterion "
        "each fails. Do not write 'the only', 'the sole', or 'the single' unless you "
        "enumerated and checked the whole pool. Never state a figure that is not present in "
        "the numbered evidence. Never declare a candidate's data missing without re-scanning "
        "the numbered evidence for it first — if the figure is there, include or exclude that "
        "candidate on the merits, citing the figure. Check that every core figure is cited "
        "to the question's named source (or one consistent canonical source per metric); if "
        "a core figure only has a substitute source while the named source is reachable, "
        "fetch the named source before finalizing. Re-read the question's explicit "
        "output-format instructions (ordering, list format, words to include or omit) and "
        "make the final answer obey them exactly — such instructions control how you WRITE "
        "the answer text, never which entities qualify: an instruction to omit a word means "
        "write the qualifying entity's name without that word, not exclude the entity.\n\n"
        "FINAL ANSWER:\n"
        "End with a committed, SELF-CONTAINED answer: state the answer first, then a compact "
        "proof — each qualifying entity with the figures that qualify it, and the near-miss "
        "exclusions with the exact criterion each fails — written as flowing prose "
        "paragraphs with [n] citations: no markdown bullets, headers, bold or tables "
        "unless the question itself asks for a list or a table. State the answer in the "
        "first sentence. Do NOT reproduce the working table or internal scaffolding; "
        "rewrite the proof as prose. Do NOT end with a summary or recap that restates "
        "figures already given. The FINAL ANSWER must carry the completeness claim on "
        "its own: say what pool you checked and how many entries it held, and name only "
        "the near-misses whose exclusion needs a reason, each with the criterion it "
        "fails. Do NOT list the entries that simply do not qualify — a roster of names "
        "that carry no failing criterion is a candidate dump, it lowers nothing but the "
        "reader's patience, and it loses the comparison. Scoring is pairwise against a "
        "competitor: an answer that refuses, defers, or hedges to 'insufficient data' loses "
        "outright, and so does a bare answer with no completeness proof. If evidence covers "
        "only part of the pool, commit to the best-supported answer and note that the roster "
        "may be incomplete.\n\n"
        "CITATION RULE: in the final answer, put the evidence number in brackets immediately "
        "after EVERY factual claim — e.g. 'the total is 4,000 [7, 12].' A claim with no "
        "bracket after it is assumed uncited. Cite the sources that carry the facts the "
        "question asks for; a page fetched only to confirm a category or identity that "
        "the named source already settles is not cited."
