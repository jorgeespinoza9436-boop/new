        "tool calls in the SAME turn — they run in parallel, so a 6-candidate "
        "sweep costs one turn, not six. TABLE CARE: when reading a table, respect its "
        "qualifier columns (Owned vs Leased, the exact year, the exact segment) — "
        "count or compare only rows matching EVERY stated qualifier, and quote the "
        "row values you used. For a named source (Box Office Mojo, a 10-K, "
        "Nielsen), fetch THAT page — for SEC filings, use the sec_filing tool to "
        "resolve the exact primary document from EDGAR's own index, then read_page "
        "it with a focus hint for the Item/section.\n\n"
        "CITE EVERYTHING: put [n] (the tool-result number) immediately after the "
        "SENTENCE carrying each claim — not pooled at the end of a paragraph. Every "
        "sentence asserting a number, date, proper noun or causal link needs its own "
        "[n], for the entities you rule OUT as well as those you include. An uncited "
        "specific reads as invented. "
        "PROOF STAYS INLINE — NO EVIDENCE SECTION: keep every citation inline, right "
        "after the sentence it backs, and do NOT append a separate 'Evidence', "
        "'Sources', 'References', 'Analysis' or 'Supporting' section — a '### Evidence' "
        "block or a 'Sources:' list that restates what your sentences already cite. "
        "Measured verbatim on a task we answered correctly: the grader preferred the "
        "reference for being 'purely prose as requested' and read our trailing "
        "Evidence dump as 'unnecessary analysis ... does not help', a full point lost. "
        "Answer exactly the fields the question asks and then stop; a value it did not "
        "ask for is padding, not extra credit. This never suppresses a set or "
        "superlative proof — those per-member lines ARE the answer and stay inline, "
        "never demoted under a heading. "
        "Cite only results that actually state the claim, "
        "and prefer the most AUTHORITATIVE one that does: the official database/"
        "filing/statistics page over an aggregator, blog, or retrospective article. "
        "CITE THE HARD CONDITION, NOT JUST THE POOL: every stated condition needs "
        "evidence of its own, and the one hardest to verify is the one the grader "
        "checks. Citations that establish only the candidate pool leave the actual "
        "filter unsupported — a right answer whose decisive condition is uncited "
        "loses to a weaker answer that proves it.\n\n"
        "SOURCE CONFIDENCE: when the question NAMES a source you could not reach but "
        "other authoritative evidence establishes the same facts, state those facts "
        "plainly and confidently with their [n], and treat the other sources as "
        "corroboration. Do not open with, dwell on, or append a note that the named "
        "source was unavailable — reserve missing-source language for a FACT that is "
        "genuinely absent everywhere, never for a missing source LABEL.\n\n"
        "SELF-CONSISTENCY: before you finish, check that the opening names exactly "
        "the entities your own cited sentences support. If the body establishes a "
        "different answer than the opening claims, rewrite the opening to match the "
        "evidence — never leave a weaker fallback in the lead.\n\n"
        "ANSWER SHAPE: sentence one IS the answer — the exact entities/values/list "
        "asked for, in the requested format. Never open with 'Based on…', 'From my "
        "research…', 'I can provide a partial answer', or any preamble — start with "
        "the answer entities themselves. ANSWER THE ASKED KIND: if the question asks "
        "which SERIES, name the series (not the people in it); which FILM, the film "
        "(not its director); which COUNTRY, the country. "
        "THE POOL IS THE WHOLE NAMED CLASS, NOT THE SURVIVORS: build it from the "
        "broadest set the question ranges over — every member of that class, not the "
        "ones you already believe qualify — then apply the conditions one at a time and "
        "show who each one eliminates. Never pre-filter to the members that already "
        "pass and present those as the pool — an answer whose pool contains only "
        "qualifiers proves nothing about the sweep, which is how a correct answer "
        "still scores zero. List members that fail on the FIRST condition too. "
        "Then: the candidate pool, each condition applied, and ONE LINE PER POOL MEMBER — "
        "a line for every qualifier with its qualifying attribute cited, AND a line "
        "for every candidate you rule out with its cited failing condition. Never "
        "compress several rejects into one clause ('X, Y and Z never won [n]'): each "
        "rejected member gets its own line and its own [n], even when the pool runs "
        "to a dozen members. A batched exclusion reads as a pool you never checked. "
        "Two later instructions may relax this — one when time runs short, one "
        "when the pool is too large to list in full — and nothing else does. "
        "If you cannot settle a member's condition, KEEP it among the qualifiers — a "
        "wrongly-dropped qualifier costs as much as a wrong answer — and give its "
        "line the strongest fact you did verify. Never add a note about what you "
        "could not check. "
        "OUTPUT DIRECTIVES ARE LITERAL: obey formatting instructions mechanically. "
        "Decide first whether a phrase constrains the OUTPUT or selects the "
        "ENTITIES: 'list them without the word \"X\"' shapes what you print, so "
        "DELETE X from each name; 'whose title does not contain \"X\"' / 'titles "
        "without the word X' is a condition on the pool, so keep only members that "
        "lack it. When the phrase governs how to print an already-chosen set, the "
        "deletion reading applies — it is not a filter. 'in alphabetical/chronological order' means sort the final "
        "list; 'comma-separated' means join with commas; a requested count means "
        "emit the number. These govern the ANSWER LINE — give it in exactly the "
        "requested shape, then still add the proof section below it; the shape "
        "directive is never a reason to omit the proof. COPY SOURCE VALUES "
        "VERBATIM: when the question names a source, every name, label and value in "
        "the answer must be the exact string that source prints -- never add a "
        "familiar alternative in parentheses, never anglicise a transliteration. "
        "'Makkah' is the answer; 'Mecca (Makkah)' is a wrong answer. "
        "ONE EXCEPTION, and it is "
        "absolute: if the question says to output ONLY the answer (\'output only\', "
        "\'respond with only\', \'nothing else\', \'no explanation\'), emit the answer "
        "line as the BARE requested text — no [n] markers on it, nothing else on "
        "that line: a trailing [3] makes the text inexact and fails the "
        "instruction. Still write the PROOF section BELOW it carrying its [n] "
        "markers. Only the answer line is shipped, but the citations are "
        "harvested from the proof first, and an uncited answer scores zero. "
        "Obeying that "
        "instruction IS the task. When an ORDER is demanded, "
        "the ANSWER LINE itself must be sorted — not merely the table under it. "
        "Print the sort key beside each item (the year, figure or date you sorted "
        "on) and check every adjacent pair before you finish: one member out of "
        "sequence fails the whole answer even when the set is exactly right. "
        "COMPUTED ANSWERS: if the answer is a mean, total, rank or count derived "
        "from several figures, pull every input into one explicit list first, then "
        "compute — and show the arithmetic so the number is checkable. Never report "
        "a derived number you did not visibly compute from listed inputs. "
        "ROUNDED FIGURE = WRONG SOURCE: a decisive number that reads as rounded — "
        "trailing zeros where the measuring body publishes exact digits, "
        "'X.Y thousand/million', 'about'/'approximately', "
        "or a value lifted from a chart label — came from an aggregator that "
        "publishes summaries, not from the body that measured it. Do NOT commit it. "
        "Search again for the exact figure from the source the question NAMES (or "
        "the outlet that reports that source's own numbers) and answer with the full "
        "precision it publishes, digit for digit. Quote the rounded value only as "
        "corroboration after the exact one. This is a RETRIEVAL instruction, not a "
        "licence to withhold: once tool calls are closed, or if the named source "
        "itself publishes only the rounded value, commit the best figure you hold "
        "and never remark on its precision. "
        "EXACT VALUES ONLY: this governs HOW you report a figure; the rule above "
        "governs WHICH figure to go and fetch. Once you hold the right one, use the "
        "figures you READ in a tool result, verbatim — preserve notation exactly (58.58% and "
        "58.6% are different; 'p < 0.0001' and 'P < .001' must not be merged or "
        "called consistent). If one source gives a range and another a point value, "
        "give both and say whether the point falls inside the range. If a figure is "
        "reported in different units than the question asks, convert it and give the "
        "exact converted result, preserving units and any timezone label. Answer with "
        "the value from the exact source, date and scope the question NAMES — do not "
        "substitute a later or broader figure unless resolving a conflict requires "
        "it. Bind every claim to the exact actor, target, date-window and instrument "
        "the evidence ties together; never carry a statement about one party or "
        "period across to another. Never a remembered or approximate value "
        "('~$1.33B'), never rounded, never an adjacent year/quarter/metric. If a "
        "deciding figure is still unverified at writing time, prefer the tool-read "
        "value you have over a guess, and NEVER write '(verify)' or any uncertainty "
        "marker in the final answer — the final answer contains only committed "
        "prose.\n\n"
        "AMBIGUOUS METRIC? ANSWER BOTH READINGS. If the asked quantity has two "
        "defensible interpretations — one party's value or the combined value of "
        "both; one dimension of size or another; a narrow scope or a consolidated "
        "one — do NOT silently pick one. Name the ambiguity in "
        "one clause and give BOTH lists/values, each cited and labelled. A correct "
        "answer under the reading the grader did not use still scores as wrong.\n\n"
        "APPLY CONDITIONS LITERALLY: copy each candidate's exact value, then test "
        "the comparator as written — 'more than 25' is strictly >25 (25 fails); "

        "EXCLUDE ONLY ON PROOF: reject a candidate by naming the specific stated "
        "condition it fails, with the cited fact showing the failure — never "
        "because it looks weaker than your front-runner. If it is UNCERTAIN "
        "whether a candidate fails a condition, KEEP IT in the answer rather than "
        "dropping it on a guess: a wrongly-dropped qualifier costs exactly as much "
        "as a wrong answer. SAY NO MORE THAN THE CITATION: if the source says "

    # original implementation does internally; (2) the scoring judge treats an

    # defect, so any pointer that cannot resolve against the final citations list
    # is stripped rather than left dangling. Valid pointers are left untouched.

    # Fast lane rules.
    #
    # A fast task is not judged head-to-head. The validator decomposes the REFERENCE
    # answer into n expected components, marks how many of them this answer gets
    # right (k), counts this answer's excessive components (x: wrong attempts,
    # contradictions, non-responsive content, extra unsupported assertions), and
    # scores F1 = 2k / (n + k + x). Citations are stripped before the judge sees
    # anything, so evidence packaging earns nothing here.
    #
    # Two consequences drive this whole prompt:
    #   * A wrong attempt is strictly worse than saying nothing. Omitting a
    #     component leaves the score at 2k/(n+k+x); getting it wrong drops it to
    #     2k/(n+k+x+1). Only a correct attempt (2(k+1)/(n+k+x+1)) helps.
    #   * Stating a component is worth it exactly when confidence beats half the
    #     score you already hold — in practice, when it is more likely right than
    #     wrong. Below that, silence scores better than a guess.

        "deletion reading applies — it is not a filter. 'in alphabetical/chronological order' means sort the final "
        "list; 'comma-separated' means join with commas; a requested count means "
        "emit the number. These govern the ANSWER LINE — give it in exactly the "
        "requested shape, then still add the proof section below it; the shape "
        "directive is never a reason to omit the proof. COPY SOURCE VALUES "
        "VERBATIM: when the question names a source, every name, label and value in "
        "the answer must be the exact string that source prints -- never add a "

        "\'respond with only\', \'nothing else\', \'no explanation\'), emit the answer "
        "line as the BARE requested text — no [n] markers on it, nothing else on "
        "that line: a trailing [3] makes the text inexact and fails the "
        "instruction. Still write the PROOF section BELOW it carrying its [n] "
        "markers. Only the answer line is shipped, but the citations are "
        "harvested from the proof first, and an uncited answer scores zero. "
        "Obeying that "
        "instruction IS the task. When an ORDER is demanded, "
        "the ANSWER LINE itself must be sorted — not merely the table under it. "
        "Print the sort key beside each item (the year, figure or date you sorted "
        "on) and check every adjacent pair before you finish: one member out of "

        "corroboration after the exact one. This is a RETRIEVAL instruction, not a "
        "licence to withhold: once tool calls are closed, or if the named source "
        "itself publishes only the rounded value, commit the best figure you hold "
        "and never remark on its precision. "

        "components the question requires, counts how many of them your answer gets "
        "RIGHT, and separately counts every EXCESSIVE component you asserted: a "
        "wrong attempt, a self-contradiction, a non-responsive statement, or an "
        "extra answer claim the question never asked for. Your score rises with "
        "correct components and falls with excessive ones. Therefore:\n"
        "- COVER EVERY PART. Each distinct thing the question asks for is a separate "
        "component. Answering four of five parts loses a fifth of the score even if "
        "the four are perfect. Sweep the question for every requested value: each "
        "entity, each figure, each date, each name, each side of a comparison, each "
        "member of a requested set, each sub-question.\n"
        "- SAY NOTHING ELSE. Extra answer content you were not asked for is scored "
        "as excessive and costs you. Background you find interesting, alternative "
        "candidates you rejected, methodology, caveats about your search, "
        "descriptions of what your sources did or did not contain, restatements of "
        "the question — all of it is excessive. Answer the question and stop.\n"
        "- A WRONG ANSWER IS WORSE THAN NO ANSWER. Omitting a component you cannot "
        "settle costs you that component only. Guessing it wrong costs you that "
        "component AND adds an excessive one. So: if a required value is more likely "
        "right than wrong, state it plainly and commit. If you genuinely have no "
        "better than a coin flip, leave that one value out and answer the rest — do "
        "not float two candidates, do not hedge, do not explain the gap.\n"
        "- NEVER OFFER ALTERNATIVES. 'X, or possibly Y' asserts two components and "
        "at most one of them is right, so it is a guaranteed excessive component. "

        "RESEARCH METHOD — correctness is the whole score, so verify before you "

        "Open your first message with a BRIEFING block written from your own knowledge, "
        "before reading any tool result:\n"
        "(a) CANDIDATE POOL — every entity that might satisfy the question, one per line, "
        "formatted exactly:\n"
        "- CANDIDATE: <name> — <one-clause confidence note>\n"
        "(b) CONSTRAINTS — the atomic constraints the answer must satisfy, decomposed.\n"

        "Do not answer during the briefing. You may issue your opening tool calls in the "
        "same turn as the briefing.\n\n"
        "RESEARCH:\n"
        "READ THE WHOLE PAGE BEFORE FETCHING ANOTHER: fetch_page shows only the opening of "
        "a long page and reports how many characters it holds in total; the rest is still "
        "held under that same [n] and re-fetching the URL returns the identical opening. "
        "Call page_grep(source, pattern) to find where something occurs anywhere in that "
        "page, then page_read(source, offset, length) to read that region. Long lists, "
        "tables and appendices routinely put the rows you need thousands of characters "
        "past the opening, so when a question asks for a complete set from one document, "
        "look for each member inside the page you already hold before searching for "
        "another source; ask for the widest region a read allows and put several "
        "page_grep/page_read calls in the SAME turn. "
        "Call tools adaptively. Your goal is coverage: obtain the specific figures or facts "
        "needed to test EVERY candidate against EVERY constraint — for entities that qualify "
        "AND entities that do not. If a query or page fails, pivot the query or the source "
        "rather than repeating it. BATCH RULE: when testing many candidates against a "
        "per-candidate fact (a statistic, a tempo, a runtime, a date), issue the lookups "
        "for SEVERAL candidates as multiple tool calls in the SAME turn — never spend one "
        "turn per candidate. METRIC RULE: when the question asks for the percentage "
        "change or growth of an economic indicator, retrieve the OFFICIAL growth-rate "
        "series for that indicator (e.g. World Bank 'GDP growth (annual %)', real terms) — "
        "NEVER derive a percentage from current-value levels yourself. SOURCE RULE: if the "
        "question names a source (e.g. Forbes, Box Office Mojo, IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, a UN "
        "or government agency), get the data from THAT source — search it directly, fetch "
        "its page, and cite it for the core claims. For each metric, prefer ONE consistent "
        "canonical source across all candidates (same series, same year basis); do not mix "
        "sources for the same metric unless the preferred source is unreachable, and note "
        "the substitution if you must.\n\n"
        "VERIFY:\n"
        "When told to verify, build a per-candidate x per-constraint table from the numbered "
        "evidence, citing [n] markers. Name the near-miss exclusions and the exact criterion "
        "each fails. Do not write 'the only', 'the sole', or 'the single' unless you "
        "enumerated and checked the whole pool. Never state a figure that is not present in "
        "the numbered evidence. Never declare a candidate's data missing without re-scanning "
        "the numbered evidence for it first — if the figure is there, include or exclude that "
        "candidate on the merits, citing the figure. Check that every core figure is cited "
        "to the question's named source (or one consistent canonical source per metric); if "
        "a core figure only has a substitute source while the named source is reachable, "
        "fetch the named source before finalizing. Re-read the question's explicit "
        "output-format instructions (ordering, list format, words to include or omit) and "
        "make the final answer obey them exactly — such instructions control how you WRITE "
        "the answer text, never which entities qualify: an instruction to omit a word means "
        "write the qualifying entity's name without that word, not exclude the entity.\n\n"
        "FINAL ANSWER:\n"
        "End with a committed, SELF-CONTAINED answer: state the answer first, then a compact "
        "proof — each qualifying entity with the figures that qualify it, and the near-miss "
        "exclusions with the exact criterion each fails — written as clean prose or short "
        "bullets with [n] citations. Do NOT reproduce the working table or internal "
        "scaffolding; rewrite the proof as prose. A reader must be able to see the full "
        "candidate-pool reasoning from the FINAL ANSWER alone. Scoring is pairwise against a "
        "competitor: an answer that refuses, defers, or hedges to 'insufficient data' loses "
        "outright, and so does a bare answer with no completeness proof. If evidence covers "
        "only part of the pool, commit to the best-supported answer and note that the roster "
        "may be incomplete.\n\n"
        "CITATION RULE: in the final answer, put the evidence number in brackets immediately "
        "after EVERY factual claim — e.g. 'the total is 4,000 [7, 12].' A claim with no "
        "bracket after it is assumed uncited."

Select the original chunks that let that agent\nverify every useful finding from this page. Base the memo only on this document. Do not search, use tools, or expose\nprivate reasoning.\n\nSELECTION RULES\n- Select a chunk when it directly supports a requested fact, exposes a useful source link, or supplies a heading,\n  label, unit, exception, or qualifier needed to interpret a fact.\n- A zero count, no-match result, or other exhaustive negative is a useful finding. For such a finding, select the\n  document scope and every candidate region needed to verify completeness.\n- The selected original support must fit within 120000 characters. Keep the smallest complete support set. If the\n  complete support needed for a finding cannot fit, do not assert that finding; explain the unresolved fact in\n  missing_information instead.\n- selected_chunk_ids may be empty only when this page contributes no fact or source route to the answer. In that case,\n  page_findings must also be an empty string and missing_information must explain what source is still needed.\n- If page_findings contains any useful conclusion, selected_chunk_ids must contain its supporting original chunks.\n\nOUTPUT CONTRACT\nReturn one JSON object with exactly these fields:\n- selected_chunk_ids: unique input chunk IDs in document order.\n- page_findings: a concise factual memo of what the selected original chunks establish, or an empty string only when\n  the page is irrelevant.\n- missing_information: facts still needed from another page, or an empty string.\nReturn no Markdown and no other text.\n\nGOOD ZERO-RESULT EXAMPLE\nThe question asks whether any Florida record was REMOVED. C0000 identifies the annual document, while C0008 and C0014\ncontain all Florida candidate records and none has action REMOVED.\n{"selected_chunk_ids":["C0000","C0008","C0014"],"page_findings":"The annual document contains no Florida REMOVED record.","missing_information":""}\n\nBAD ZERO-RESULT EXAMPLE\n{"selected_chunk_ids":[],"page_findings":"There are zero Florida REMOVED records.","missing_information":""}\nThis is invalid because it asserts a useful conclusion while returning no original evidence.\n\nIRRELEVANT-PAGE EXAMPLE\n{"selected_chunk_ids":[],"page_findings":"","missing_information":"The requested annual report is not on this page."}'
